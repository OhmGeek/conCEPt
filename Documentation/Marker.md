# Marker Page Documentation
## Introduction
If you are a marker of any kind: either a supervisor or examiner, then this document is for you.

This document acts as an instruction manual, for navigating the system and understanding the mentality of the site.

## Browser Compatibility
The system itself has been tested in Safari, and Google Chrome. While it should work in Firefox and Internet Explorer, we recommend use with Google Chrome where possible (or the open source version, Chromium).

## Logging In
Simply navigate to the system, and login using your CIS username and password. If you receive a 403 error, contact a superadmin (the module coordinator). They will need to add you as a marker. 

This will then take you to the home page.

## Home Page
The home page is the central location for your marking. It lists all your students, and the associated forms. It also displays the status of each of these forms.

By navigating through the tabs, you can see the pending forms, any clashes with the opposing marker (the other marker who is conducting evaluation of the student's work), and the merged forms (ones that need editing, confirming, and completed forms).

It is from here that you can select the forms to mark.

On the 'All' tab, students are divided into ones that you are examiner for, and the ones that you are supervising. This allows the distinction between the two different marker roles to be realised.

## Students
Clicking on the students button simply takes you back to the home page. It's a quick shortcut to bring you back to the most important page on the site.

## History
The history page lists all documents that have been submitted, with an associated comment. This allows you to see all changes with the student forms.

## Documents
While searching by student is sometimes useful, if you are looking for something in particular it might become quite difficult to look through a large list of students.

This is where the documents section comes in. Simply select the document name from the drop down menu, and this will allow you to select a student and therefore see their associated form. This replaces the need for using the find feature of your web browser.
