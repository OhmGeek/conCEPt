# Admin Page - how to use
## Introduction
The Admin Page is used by reception staff to deal with any administrative tasks related to the system.

From this part of the site, you can:

- Add Students/Markers
- Link Students/Markers
- Print each form as a PDF.

### Marker/Supervisor Difference
Markers are those who mark students' work. A supervisor is also considered to be a marker, as they are essentially a secondary marker.

## Logging in

You should have already been added as an admin by the super admin (typically the coordinator for the projects). Then navigate to the URL of the site, and enter your CIS username and password in the box that appears. You should then be automatically be routed to the admin home page. 

If you see the text "403 Not Authorised", contact the module coordinator, as you haven't been added as an admin.

## Home Page

The home page is just great. It allows you to see the status of marking thusfar. 

There are quick links that allow you to do tasks quickly. Just click on them and you will be taken to the correct page. 

Furthermore you can see how many markers and students there are currently in the system, along with a suitably colourful graphic showing how many forms are submitted/unsubmitted. Oh, and not forgetting the beautiful image of the cathedral! 


## Adding Students/Markers
To add students/markers, simply navigate to the Add page (either using the navbar, or from the main page).

Using the CIS username of a student, you can add them as a student. You might also need to enter their first and last name, if they haven't already been entered into the system.

You can do exactly the same with markers. Please note, this also includes supervisors as well.

## Linking Students with Examiners and supervisors

Once you've added students and markers, you can associate them with one another. Simply insert their usernames for each supervisor, examiner and student, and if they are already in the database, the details will be automatically completed for you (convenient!).

If needed, the autocompleted information can be changed via editing the text box, in case information is not correct.

Once you've entered the information, and you feel committed enough to make such an important change, click the 'Add Relationship' button. This relationship will securely link the examiner and supervisor to their student for the year. 

When this beautiful relationship is created, forms are automatically created, linking the forms to each pair, and the sections will be automatically created. :D 

Look at the magnificent relationship you created!

When the examiner/supervisor logs in, they will see all of these forms, and they can start filling them out.

## Printing Documents
Once the marking has undergone agreement, and the final mark has been awarded, you will be able to print the PDF statement of marks. This can be done through the print tab of the admin site.

For each username, you will see the documents in PDF form. Simply click on the link and download the PDF file. You can then upload this to DUO/print it out.
